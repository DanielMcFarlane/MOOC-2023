# To create a loop you'll often need to include three distinct steps: 
# Initialisation, condition, and updating the iteration variables.

# Initialisation
# number = int(input("Please type in a number: "))

# Condition
# while number <10:

# Updating variables
# print(number)
# number += 1

# print("Execution finished.")

# Write your solution here
number = 2

while number <= 30:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)
    number += 1
